        "markdown": "Hello! This is a slightly more complicated demo to push the limits (ceiling?) of the system and just a fun proof of concept for using Mew for more complicated things to come!\n\nHere we have 2 bots playing rock paper scissors against each other:\n- the first bot (player 1) is an honest bot. it only has access to the previous game history and needs to make a play based on that.\n- the second bot (cheating bot) is cheating (*gasp*)\n\nStart the Scratch project and click on the auto button. It will ask you how many rounds you want the bots to play and you can input something from 1~10 (go higher than 10 and you'll run out of the 5000 token limit i think - do try to break it tho! i want to find and fix these problems as early as I can!)\n\nThis project started with simulating 2 honest bots with different system prompts but i soon realized it was so boring because the results were just 1/3 win 1/3 lose 1/3 tie all the time, so i wanted to see if making one cheat would make things more interesting.\n\nInitially, the agent nodes were connected to a llama3.2 running locally on my computer and the results of the cheating bot was so inconsistent I wanted to see how it was still losing so much. that's why the scratch project plots out the win rates over time. \n\nUnfortunately, since switching to gpt 3.5 turbo, the cheating bot's performance has become much more consistent and predictable and now the win rate chart looks rather redundant. One interesting future step for this experiment is to test out different models of llms against each other and see which one scores the highest on the all important rock-paper-scissors-benchmark."
