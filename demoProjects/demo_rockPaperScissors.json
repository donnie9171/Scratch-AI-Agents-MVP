Please read this first!\n## Introduction\nWelcome to MEW, an experimental project exploring what a node based AI system could look like in Scratch!\n## Basic navigation\n- **Loading sample projects:** Click the \"Load\" button on the top left corner to load different projects. I recommend loading and exploring the sample projects in order to get the hang of how things work step by step.\n\n- **Running sample projects:** Click on the green flag on the stage in the top right to start a project. Feel free to check out what the projects look like on Scratch! Their project ids are visible in the textbox up top.\n\n- **Creating your own projects:** Click \"Load\" then choose \"Empty Project\" to create a blank project.\n\n- **Saving your projects:** Currently, there is no backend for project data so you need to export and keep your project data safe by clicking on the \"Save\" button in the top left corner then clicking \"Copy\" to copy the project data as text to your clipboard. Paste this somewhere you can easily find. \n\n- **Inspecting and editing nodes:** You can inspect and configure nodes by clicking on them. An inspector will pop up and present you with different options depending on the node type. \n\n## Feedback\nYou can send in your feedback and any comments via the \"Feedback\" button at the top left. You can also include the project file if you'd like. If you have any fun creations and experiments, please also send them my way with the form! Excited to see what everyone comes up with!\n\n****\n\n## Nodes\nHere is some basic documentation about each node type and how they currently work.\n### Overall node running system"
